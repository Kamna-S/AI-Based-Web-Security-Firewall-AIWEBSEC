# AI-Based Web Security Firewall (AIWEBSEC)

AIWEBSEC is an advanced cybersecurity solution designed to protect web applications from malicious attacks using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Unlike traditional firewalls, AIWEBSEC continuously learns and adapts to new threats, providing robust and dynamic protection for online assets.

## Key Features

- **Threat Detection and Prevention**: AIWEBSEC employs AI algorithms to detect and prevent cyber threats like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and DDoS attacks in real-time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: By analyzing historical data and traffic patterns, AIWEBSEC identifies anomalies and potential security breaches, even those previously unseen.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: The system monitors user behavior to distinguish between legitimate users and potential attackers, offering a more precise security mechanism.
- **Automated Responses**: Upon detecting a threat, AIWEBSEC can automatically block malicious IP addresses and mitigate attacks without human intervention.

## Benefits

AIWEBSEC enhances web application security by providing continuous, adaptive protection against evolving cyber threats. It minimizes false positives, reduces the need for manual oversight, and ensures a more secure online environment for businesses and users. With AIWEBSEC, organizations can confidently protect their web assets and maintain the integrity of their digital operations.
